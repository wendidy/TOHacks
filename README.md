# TOHacks 2020
# Theme:
  "Using your individual experiences and background, tackle a social issue that you believe can be solved through technology. 
  Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has attracted global attention. 
  How do you believe technology can be implemented into strategic solutions to benefit the post-COVID world?"

Plans for now:
  Using node.js to build a browser chat box app. (Which is kind of irrelevant to the theme for now)
  Web dev (Promote awareness of different diseases around the world)
  
  Virtual chatting box, you will be able to see other people's virtual figures. 
    For now we are only able to do it 2D, and nothing about setting user preferences.
    In the future we can look more into it, and hopefully launch an app
