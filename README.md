# TOHacks 2020
# Theme:
  "Using your individual experiences and background, tackle a social issue that you believe can be solved through technology. 
  Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has attracted global attention. 
  How do you believe technology can be implemented into strategic solutions to benefit the post-COVID world?"

Plans for now:
  Using node.js to build a browser chat box app. (Which is kind of irrelevant to the theme for now)
  Web dev (Promote awareness of different diseases around the world)
