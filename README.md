# TOHacks 2020 - Covid Lounge

Plans for now:
  Using node.js to build a browser chat box app, for people to hang
  
  Our platform creates a virtual world for people's digital figures to interact with each. 
  They are able to walk around, and after pressing "Enter", then type in what they want to say, and press "Enter" again,
  there will be a chat box floating on their head, which lasts a couple of seconds.
  
  We use Hamachi to host the server.
  
  For now we are only able to do it 2D, and nothing about user preferences.
  In the future we can look more into it, and hopefully launch an app.
